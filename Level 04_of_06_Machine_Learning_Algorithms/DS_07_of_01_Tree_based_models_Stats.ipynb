    "Entropy, so far, had been a concept in physics. Namely, it is the (log of the) number of microstates or microscopic configurations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, if the particles inside a system have **many possible positions to move around**, then the system has **high entropy**, and if they have to stay rigid, then the system has **low entropy**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, water in its three states, solid, liquid, and gas, has different entropies. The molecules in ice have to stay in a lattice, as it is a rigid system, so **ice has low entropy**. The molecules in water have more positions to move around, so **water** in liquid state has **medium entropy**. The molecules inside water **vapor** can pretty much go anywhere they want, so water vapor has **high entropy**.\n",

Well, as a first attempt, let’s remember the definition of entropy: If molecules have many possible rearrangements, then the system has high entropy, and if they have very few rearrangements, then the system has low entropy. So a first attempt would be to count the number of rearrangements of these balls. In this case, we have 1 possible rearrangement for Bucket 1, 4 for Bucket 2, and 6 for Bucket 3, this number given by the binomial coefficient.\n",

We’re shown the balls in the bucket in some order, so let’s say, they’re shown to us in that precise order, red, red, red, blue.

    "# Turning Products into Sums\n",

Here we have a product of 4 numbers, which is not bad, but imagine if we had a million data points. How would the product of a million small probabilities (between 0 and 1) would look? It would be a ridiculously tiny number. In general we want to avoid products as much as we can. What’s better than a product? Well, a sum! And how do we turn products into sums? Exactly, using the logarithm function, since the following identity will be very helpful:\n",

    "First, let’s get the easy case out of the way. If the bucket is Bucket 1, we know for sure that the letter is an A. So right there, we know that for Bucket 1, we need to ask 0 questions on average, to guess what letter we got. For the sake of redundancy, let’s put it in a formula:\n",

    "- Is the letter a B?\n",
    "- Is the letter a C?\n",
    "- Is the letter a D?\n",

    "So, first off, the fourth question is redundant, since if the answer to all the previous ones is “no”, then we know for sure that the letter is a D. So three questions is enough. Now, can we do better than that? Well, our questions don’t need to be independent. We can tailor our question 2 based on the answer to question 1, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the letter A or B?\n",
    "\n",
    "a) If the answer to question 1 is “yes”: Is the letter A? If the answer to question 1 is “no”: Is the letter C?\n",

If we want to find out a letter drawn out of a bucket, the average number of questions we must ask to find out (if we ask our questions in the smartest possible way), is at least the entropy of the set. This means, the entropy of the set is a lower bound on the number of questions we must ask in average to find out. In the cases we saw above, the number of questions is exactly the entropy. In general, this won’t happen, we may need to ask more questions than the entropy. But we will never be able to do it with less questions than the entropy of the set."
